## Project description:

There is a navigation bar where you can login and with a movie search  by name. When searching, movie cards will appear with the option to save to favorites and see more details.
There is also a button to go to favorites and see the saved movies and this time instead of the option to save to favorites, we have the option to delete from favorites.
